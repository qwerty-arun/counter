# BUILD A COUNTER
Design and build a counter which uses two seven segment displays(max count=99). There will be both increment and decrement options. </br>
Two models can be made: Mechanical and Electronic </br>
Mechanical model will involve push button which counts and another reset button to again start at 00.</br>

Electronic model will involve battery, some push button, counter, reset button or we can override a switch.</br>

# TIMELINE: 
- Half an hour daily for a month. </br>

# LIST OF WORK TO BE DONE
- [ ] Identify the knowledge gap
- [ ] Work on fixing the knowlede gap
- [ ] Research on the electronic components
- [ ] Circuitry design using EasyEDA
- [ ] Enclosure design using Onshape
- [ ] 3D print and test

# KNOWLEGDE GAP
### Understand EasyEDA
1) Figure out all the tutorials and documentation.</br>
2) Build some sample circuits using EasyEDA.</br>
3) Reasearch on simulation tools for circuit design and analysis. </br>
4) How to build cells' circuitry.</br> 
5) Learn about key de-bouncing. </br>

### List the circuit component 
1) Reasearch about display types. </br>
2) Are there any readymade ICs to control them? </br>
3) Build the circuit using a simulator or breadboard</br>
4) What power source are you going to use? </br>

### Look and feel 
1) Design the enclosure using Onshape.
